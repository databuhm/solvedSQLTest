/*
Consider P1(a,b) and P2(c,d) to be two points on a 2D plane.

a happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
b happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
c happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
d happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).

Query the Manhattan Distance between points P1 and P2 and round it to a scale of 4 decimal places.

Input Format
The STATION table is described as follows:

CREATE TABLE STATION (
    ID NUMBER,
    CITY VARCHAR2(21),
    STATE VARCHAR2(2),
    LAT_N NUMBER,
    LONG_W NUMBER
)
;

where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.
*/

-- Solution
SELECT ROUND(ABS(MIN(LAT_N)-MAX(LAT_N))+ABS(MIN(LONG_W)-MAX(LONG_W)), 4)
FROM STATION
;

/*
Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

Equilateral: It's a triangle with 3 sides of equal length.
Isosceles: It's a triangle with 2 sides of equal length.
Scalene: It's a triangle with 3 sides of differing lengths.
Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.

Input Format
The TRIANGLES table is described as follows:

CREATE TABLE TRIANGLES (
    A INTEGER,
    B INTEGER,
    C INTEGER
)
;

Each row in the table denotes the lengths of each of a triangle's three sides.
*/

-- Solution
SELECT
    CASE 
        WHEN a + b <= c OR a + c <= b OR b + c <= a THEN 'Not A Triangle'
        WHEN a = b AND b = c THEN 'Equilateral'
        WHEN a = b OR a = c OR b = c THEN 'Isosceles'
        WHEN a != b AND b != c THEN 'Scalene'
    END output
